# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Better Than Bezos group is creating a road-trip app. The idea originated because my family is planning a three-week road-trip to California, with multiple sightseeing stops along the way, and we have found  the actual research and planning portion of the trip to be burdensome. Our CoderGirl group hopes to streamline that process by providing relevant information to the users in a consolidated and user-friendly interface.

The app will have three levels of authorization: guest, user, and admin. A guest can supply starting and ending destinations, provide some criteria (like preferences for nature or cultural institutions), and the app will provide a listing of cool places to see and restaurants to try along the drive. A user will have that same access, as well as the ability to add specific locations/destinations to their trip, save their trip, and share it with others. The admin will be able to add locations/points of interest to the general database to make them searchable by all guests and users.   

### Features
User login: User will be able to create accounts and login with username and password.

Generate itineraries: Guests and users will enter in starting and ending destinations and will be able to customize their itineraries. 

Store/share itineraries: Authorized users can save their itineraries and share them with others. 

Category preferences: Guests and users can narrow their suggested road-trip locations by selecting category preferences. 

### Technologies
Java, SpringBoot, Thymeleaf templates (with option for Angular), Hibernate, and MySQL 

### What I'll Have to Learn
We will work heavily with map APIs, and I do not know how to integrate them into code or our app. Additionally, we hope to use Angular to make the front-end of our app more attractive, but that will be a next-level add-on if we have time.
